Learning BASH scripting language for the first time and I created these 5 projects to showcase my understanding of teh basic processes.

Project 1: BINGO game - Run the script and random numbers from 1 to 75 will be generated, The conditiosn are similar to standard BINGO rules (B= 1-15, I= 16-30, N= 31=45, G= 46-60, O= 61-75).

Project 2: Countdown timer - Program that counts down to zero from a given argument (e.g. enter 5 and the timer will start from 5)

Project 3: Questionnaire - The script will ask the user 3 questions. When the user answers all questions, a sentence will print on the screen ('Hello [name] from [location]. I learned that your favorite coding website is [website]")

Project 4: Fortune Teller - Ask a question that is answerable by "yes" or "no" and the program will give you a response.

Project 5: Five - A program that runs all of the programs mentioned above in succession.
